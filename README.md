## Project Information

### Project Name

* **Project Name**: Error Resolution System

### Project Description

* **Brief Description**: •Developed an error resolving system (ERS) using Python to address infrastructure-level errors with the help of Large Language Models.(mistral AI) 
• Used SQLite to manage logs data, decorators and Flask servers for easy and fast access, gRPC for data integrity. 
• Collaborated with team members using Git to organize modifications and assign tasks. 
• Leveraged LLM-proxy for robust communication, outlines for prompt generation, and message queue for loose coupling. 

### Key Technologies
